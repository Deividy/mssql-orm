# We don't want users to instantiate Database directly for a number of reasons, but the fundamental
# point is that we cannot guarantee a valid working instance without doing async work. Also, we may
# want to check things like db version before exposing certain functionality. Loading a schema is
# another thing some people want before they get their db instance.
#
# On the error front, we could have an instantaneous error (bad config) or an error when first
# trying to connect (requires async work). So new Database() is just not nice, it would make it
# a mess for the caller to correctly check for errors. We go for this little factory instead, and as
# a bonus we can implement methods that create a DB before connecting to it, stuff like that.
#
# Database can still be instantiated directly in tests and for advanced users.
